# Quiz-Game

This quiz game is developed using oops concept in C++ language.

The game will ask 10 questions to the player. If the player answers each question correctly the program will continue till the last question , but if the user answers 
question wrong then the program will terminate and give the user their score and the correct answer of that particular question.

I have used concept like inheritance and compile-time polymorphism to build this project.

Scope of development: 1. Randomly ask question without any repitance
                      2. Add music to make it more interactive
                      
Each and every contribution will be apreciated.
